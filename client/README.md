# Client

This is the frontend of the full-stack TypeScript template, built with Vite, React, and HeroUI.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Runs the Vite dev server and GraphQL Codegen in watch mode.
- `npm run codegen` – Runs GraphQL Codegen to generate TypedDocumentNodes for queries, mutations, and fragments.
- `npm run build` – Builds the client for production.
- `npm run format` – Formats the codebase.
- `npm run lint` – Lints the codebase.

## GraphQL Codegen
The frontend uses GraphQL Codegen to generate TypeScript types for GraphQL queries. Codegen runs in watch mode during development (`npm run dev`) to keep types in sync with the backend.
